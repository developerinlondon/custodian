        <body> In association with media analysis firm Editorial Intelligence  SIR FRED&apos;S PENSION: The Independent&apos;s Dominic Lawson says Sir Fred Goodwin is perfectly cast for the role of villain. It need not have come to this farcical pass, had the government handled its negotiations with a little more attention to detail. The Daily Mail&apos;s Richard Littlejohn notes that after finding that the government cannot legally strip Goodwin of his £693,000-a-year pension, Harriet Harman is pinning her hopes on the &apos;court of public opinion&apos;. In most other circumstances the government seemingly fights tooth and nail not to give in to public opinion. The Sun&apos;s Fergus Shanahan says there are a hundred things that Labour has done that deeply offend the court of public opinion. But it&apos;s the court of law that counts. The Daily Telegraph&apos;s Boris Johnson writes that he never thought anyone could have any sympathy for Goodwin, not at least until Harriet Harman took to the airwaves. Instead of pointing public rage towards a sober examination of what has gone wrong with pay scales during the last 20 years, writes Polly Toynbee in The Guardian, the leaders of the hue and cry have swung round to sink their teeth into the usual scapegoat - the public sector. In The Times, Tom Winsor, former rail regulator, says the implications of what ministers may do to punish Goodwin could inflict enormous harm on the British economy.  BROWN AND OBAMA: Today&apos;s meeting between Gordon Brown and Barack Obama in Washington is set against the backdrop of the gravest global crisis since 1945. The Daily Mail&apos;s Max Hastings believes the crisis is not simply about money, but the fact that it has threatened the stability and political fabric of entire societies. The Independent&apos;s Steve Richards argues that Obama has not invited Brown to Washington as an act of charity. Both recognise that the current crisis requires hyperactivity from governments and a new regulatory framework for banks that can be applied globally. In The Times, Ann Treneman says the prime minister launched his historic trip to America with a pre-tour interview on talkSPORT radio. It isn&apos;t often that we hear Brown so live and unplugged, and slightly unhinged. Rachel Sylvester says the danger for Brown on his American visit is that he risks being seen as grandstanding while Britons are losing their jobs and homes. Sir Christopher Meyer, former British ambassador to Washington, says even if the &apos;special relationship&apos; is alive and well, it does not mean that we shall be more important to the US than France or Germany. There is no harm in Brown&apos;s message during his US visit that Britain has a special place in the affections of the US, says Philip Stephens in The FT, but the sentimentality about shared history, sacrifices and values lies largely on the side of the visitors.  ECONOMY: The crisis in central and eastern Europe has been triggered by the world&apos;s financial turmoil, says Bronwen Maddox in The Times. In the Daily Express, Patrick O&apos;Flynn says that as unemployment soars, even the most smug British political class should realise the folly in throwing open our jobs market and welfare state to citizens of eastern Europe. </body>

        <body> The crisis-stricken insurance company AIG has crashed $61.7bn (£43bn) into the red with the biggest corporate loss in US history after being crippled by policies protecting troubled banks against default on loans and derivatives.  In a renewed effort to prevent AIG from collapsing, the US government yesterday provided it with access to $30bn of emergency aid. This takes the amount of taxpayers&apos; funds advanced to AIG to more than $150bn.  Chief executive Ed Liddy, who was appointed under the instructions of the US government in September, said AIG was too large to be allowed to fail. &quot;Quite simply, the government believes, and we do also, that AIG is a systemically important financial institution,&quot; he said on a conference call in New York. &quot;There are just too many ­people and too many institutions in the world that depend on the promise represented by an AIG commitment.&quot;  The massive AIG loss sent the Dow Jones industrial average into a tailspin, falling below 7,000 for the first time since 1997 and ending the day nearly 300 points down on 6,763, a fall of 4.2%. The Standard &amp;amp; Poors 500 also fell - finishing the day at just over 700 after a slump of 4.7%.  AIG&apos;s fourth-quarter loss means it haemorrhaged $678m per day in the final three months of 2008, amounting to a loss of $28m per hour. It is AIG&apos;s fifth quarter in the red, with losses since 2007 totalling more than $100bn.  A large part of AIG&apos;s difficulties derive from a London office that dealt in complex transactions providing insurance on securities once considered low-risk, such as mortgage-related assets at the height of the property boom.  &quot;The marketplace is a pretty crummy place to be right now,&quot; said Liddy. &quot;When the world catches pneumonia, we get it too, in spades, because we&apos;re so large.&quot;  Operating in 130 countries, the 84-year-old insurance company serves 74m customers. It is the world&apos;s largest insurer against property damage and the top provider of retirement annuities for schoolteachers and healthcare workers.  Of its $2tn financial products operation, some $1tn of AIG&apos;s cover protects 12 global banks. The firm insures the property of 94% of the Fortune 500 companies and is the biggest owner of aircraft in the world.  The US treasury and the Federal Reserve are restructuring their lifeline to AIG by reducing interest payments and by providing a fresh capital facility of $30bn in return for preferred stock. Taxpayers will hold 77.9% of AIG, but the package is structured to prevent public ownership going above 80%, a level that could require AIG to be placed on the treasury&apos;s books.  The bail-out has proved highly contentious. AIG was pilloried for spending $440,000 on a luxury getaway for insurance salesmen at a Californian resort after receiving taxpayers&apos; aid.  In a move also likely to raise eyebrows its former chief executive Hank Greenberg, who was ousted in 2005, said last night he would sue AIG for securities fraud. Greenberg said AIG&apos;s &quot;material misrepresentations and omissions&quot;had caused him to acquire shares as part of various deferred compensation plans at an inflated price, and later to lose nearly his entire investment after AIG&apos;s losses became known.  Donn Vickrey, an analyst at research firm Gradient Analytics, said saving AIG could cost taxpayers as much as $250bn. &quot;I think of AIG as a luxury liner that&apos;s riddled with holes and taking on water from a variety of different places,&quot; said Vickrey, who blames AIG&apos;s problems on &quot;extreme hubris, fuelled by greed&quot;.  Some argue that the treasury has gone too far in its rescue. &quot;If AIG had been pressured to put some of its divisions into bankruptcy, this crisis could have been averted,&quot; said Eli Lehrer, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington.  AIG&apos;s shares closed unchanged last night at 42 cents, valuing the business at  $1.2bn. A year ago, the shares were $46. </body>

        <body> Jamie Peacock has escaped suspension for the leading role he played in the ferocious brawl that erupted in Sunday night&apos;s World Club Challenge between Leeds and Manly, even though it was the second time the England captain has been sin-binned for fighting in only four appearances this season.  A video review panel that was set up to consider any incidents arising from the game is understood to have &quot;had a quiet word&quot; with Peacock but no further action will be taken against either him or Josh Perry, the Manly prop who was also sent to the sin bin.  &quot;Incidents like this are relatively rare in the game and, when you think about the nature of the game, that is a reflection of the discipline of the players,&quot; the Rugby Football League&apos;s chief executive, Nigel Wood, said.  Peacock, who described the brawl as &quot;just one of those things that happens in a game&quot;, also avoided a ban when he was binned and put on report for fighting with the Celtic Crusaders&apos; Australian prop Adam Peek in the first Super League match of the season last month.  Peacock will, therefore, be free to play when Leeds return to the defence of their Super League title at Warrington next Sunday. Rob Burrow, the scrum-half whose return from a back injury was ended after 16 minutes when he was laid out by a spectacular Anthony Watmough tackle, is also expected to be available, although he will have to pass a cog-test later this week.  Ashley Gibson and Ben Jones-Bishop could also return to the squad after coming through a reserve team game against Celtic Crusaders at the weekend. Stephen Tyrer, the centre who has joined the Crusaders on a season&apos;s loan from St Helens but has yet to win selection for a Super League match for the Welsh club, staked a strong claim for inclusion in next Saturday&apos;s home game against Saints by scoring four tries and kicking eight goals in a 48-40 win described by the Crusaders&apos; assistant coach, Anthony Seibold, as &quot;the club&apos;s best ever result&quot;.  Salford have launched an investigation into the misbehaviour of a small minority of their supporters in last Saturday&apos;s 52-16 defeat at Castleford. Stewards at The Jungle moved in after a flare, a plastic bottle and a toilet roll had been thrown on to the field from the Railway End, and the Salford coach, Shaun McRae, was also harangued on his way to the post-match press conference.  A more pressing concern to McRae is a suspected broken hand suffered by the club&apos;s prolific scrum-half Richie Myler. </body>

        <body>   Chelsea have paved the way for Ricardo Carvalho and Michael Essien to return to the first team after lengthy injury lay-offs as Guus Hiddink, having hoisted the team from fourth to second place since assuming the reins, looks to continue the pursuit of his &quot;main objective&quot; of automatic qualification for the Champions League at Portsmouth this evening.  Carvalho, who has been troubled by hamstring problems, and Essien began the reserve team game at Aston Villa last night, the Ghanaian making his first appearance since undergoing surgery on a cruciate knee ligament injury sustained while on international duty in September.  Essien played the full match at Villa Park and scored in the 86th minute of Chelsea&apos;s 4?3 defeat. Carvalho came through an hour untroubled before being taken off, watched by Hiddink and the new manager&apos;s assistant, Ray Wilkins.  Essien&apos;s return to competitive action ? most likely later this month ? will be a welcome boost to Hiddink, who has overseen three successive wins and still harbours faint hopes of hauling back Manchester United in the title race. &quot;The main objective, when we started talking about me taking up the role for the rest of the season, was to qualify automatically for the Champions League,&quot; said Hiddink. &quot;What we could do &apos;extra&apos; was &apos;extra&apos;. I&apos;m not naive. United have a very good squad and, realistically, it will be difficult to catch them. But, as long as there is a possibility, you never know.  &quot;We certainly have the ambition to be in contention right to the end of May, hopefully to create some classic clashes between two powerhouses. But let&apos;s take the first few steps now.  &quot;We&apos;re going now into a decisive month. The other months are important as well, to make sure you&apos;re not too far away from your aims and targets, but I may have the luxury of having players to pick from.  &quot;I have watched Essien in training and he&apos;s close, very close. We&apos;ll have more options with him available in terms of the team&apos;s shape and tactics. It will give us some variations for the remaining games. I hope we can stop Manchester United  winning five trophies this season. I&apos;d love to stop Sir Alex Ferguson in his aim.&quot;  That was delivered with a smile. Hiddink may be without Nicolas Anelka at Fratton Park this evening, the France striker having damaged a toe against Wigan on Saturday, but would reduce the gap to United to four points with victory, albeit possibly for only 24 hours.  Chelsea&apos;s stop-gap manager is aware his objectives are short-term at present, though he reiterated yesterday that he would be willing to offer advice both on his successor and, potentially, on new signings should the club&apos;s hierarchy seek it over the remainder of the season. </body>

        <body> A therapeutic programme hailed by ministers as a hi-tech, cost-effective solution to Britain&apos;s growing problem of depression and anxiety has been widely ignored by the NHS, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without access to  treatment.  Two years after its launch, computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) is available in only a fraction of health authorities in England despite being approved for widespread NHS use by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), it has emerged.  Opposition politicians and charities have accused the government of creating a postcode lottery. Just nine of 152 primary care trusts (PCTs) have fully complied with official guidance requiring them to offer cCBT, while 38 have failed to comply at all according to figures supplied by the designers of the programme.  The programme, Beating the Blues, is a computer-based version of face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy, recognised by Nice as an effective alternative treatment to expensive prescribed medication for many people. In some cases it may prevent the need for more costly, time-consuming face-to-face therapy sessions.  MPs and Lords including Lord Howe, Baroness Tonge and Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb, who has tabled an early day motion (EDM) on the issue, have called on the government to explain its apparent failure to roll the programme out nationally.  John Smith, director of Ultrasis, the company which designed Beating the Blues, claimed the government has been  &quot;taking credit&quot; for a policy whose implementation it has failed to ensure, leaving potentially hundreds of thousands of people without access to the treatment they were promised. He says that while ministers have publicly endorsed cCBT - the latest was Dawn Primarolo, minister for public health during parliamentary questions in December last year when she called it &quot;integral&quot; to the government&apos;s wider &apos;talking therapies&apos; programme - there has been &quot;official inertia&quot; when it comes to implementation.  &quot;I don&apos;t think the government have chased PCTs up on this,&quot; Smith said.  He added that cCBT could cost as little as £30 per session and potentially save the NHS millions every year. &quot;If the Nice binding guidance was followed there would be a cost benefit to the NHS of £126m a year.&quot;  Heralded by the Department of Health (DH) in May 2007 as &quot;one of the greatest technological innovations of the decade&quot; cCBT was introduced as part of the government&apos;s much-publicised broad package of reforms to widen the availability of &quot;talking therapies&quot; including face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy on the NHS.  Talking therapies shot up the government&apos;s agenda after Lord Layard, a London School of Economics professor and author of the book Happiness, claimed that mental health was the country&apos;s &quot;biggest social problem&quot;, and convinced Number 10 that the widespread introduction of psychological therapies would have significant economic as well as health benefits.  Lamb said ministers need to take an urgent look at how cCBT has been implemented and establish a clear picture of variations of provision across the country.  &quot;I think its intolerable that this treatment, which has been approved by Nice, is not available in many parts of the country,&quot; Lamb said.  &quot;This is a proven, cost-effective treatment. Its another example of mental health not being a priority in the same way as physical health.  &quot;The government&apos;s rhetoric on this is brilliant but it doesn&apos;t match what&apos;s happening on the ground.&quot;  Sophie Corlett, the director of external relations at mental health charity Mind, said: &quot;Nice has made mandatory recommendations that cCBT should be offered to people with mild depression and anxiety and as yet this guidance has been largely ignored. PCTs are failing the millions of people who could benefit from this treatment.&quot;  The DH said cCBT implementation data was not held by central government and the treatment was just one part of a broader commitment to talking therapies.  The care services minister, Phil Hope said there were no grounds for suggesting that cCBT was not a priority.  &quot;Primary care trusts are obliged to provide funding for Nice-recommended cCBT packages where clinicians want to use them.  &quot;We expect that PCT&apos;s will roll out this service according to local needs, but clinicians are best placed to decide what treatments to use for their patients.&quot; </body>

        <body>   Nicky Butt has admitted that Newcastle United are prime candidates for relegation and that the club may require &quot;miracles&quot; if they are to survive. A 1?0 defeat against Bolton Wanderers on Sunday has left Newcastle two points above the relegation zone, with Manchester United to come tomorrow evening. There is often one unlikely club that loses form at the business end of the season and plummets into the drop zone, mentally unprepared for the fight ahead, and Butt fears this year it may be the club he captains.  Asked if Newcastle are relegation candidates, he replied: &quot;Definitely. Anyone who is sat in our dressing room thinking we are going to be OK is in danger of getting bitten on the bum. If we didn&apos;t think we were in a fight before this game, then we know we are now.&quot;  Aside from a frantic 3?2 victory at West Bromwich Albion, Newcastle have not won since 21 December and three of their next four matches are against Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea. United won 5?1 on Tyneside last season and 6?2 in 2003.  &quot;We definitely need to take something from those games now,&quot; Butt added. &quot;Our situation is getting more and more serious as the weeks go by. It couldn&apos;t be any tougher than United next. At least they are coming to St James&apos; Park, which is something. But they are probably the best team in the world at the moment ? we could play out of our skins on Wednesday and still come away with nothing. But miracles do happen and although we haven&apos;t had good results against United at home we have had against Chelsea and Arsenal.&quot;  Butt may not play tomorrow after being substituted at Bolton with a knee injury, and although Newcastle should soon have a full complement of strikers ? with Michael Owen scheduled to return at Hull City on 14 March ? they are dangerously short in midfield. Kevin Nolan, Joey Barton, Danny Guthrie and Damien Duff are all unavailable.  At the Reebok, Newcastle played Peter Lovenkrands, a striker, and Ryan Taylor, a specialist full-back, in midfield. &quot;We&apos;re just getting our strikers back, now it seems all our midfielders are getting injured,&quot; said Butt. &quot;That&apos;s the way it&apos;s been going.&quot; </body>

      <type-specific class="article">
        <body> A quarter of a century ago a law student-turned-reporter, working for the BBC in Birmingham, published a fine book on cricket. Titled The Centurions, it was a group portrait of the 17 batsmen who had scored a hundred centuries. Now Pat Murphy, with 40 books behind him, has returned to that early work, to finish what he started.  Finish is the appropriate verb, because Mark Ramprakash, the most recent addition to the centurions&apos; club, is the last man who will ever be admitted. There were 17 members when Murphy began his labours. Now there are 25, and 25 there will remain. As the author points out, the first-class programme allows the modern batsman fewer innings, and the best players spend most of their lives on the international circuit.  Murphy believes that only 10 of the 25 can be considered truly great, so it is worth listing them: Grace, Hobbs, Sutcliffe, Hammond, Bradman, Hutton, Compton, Boycott, Richards, Gooch. The surnames suffice. These are giants: &quot;those fabled men&quot;, as Roy Harper sang in his wistful ode to autumn, When An Old Cricketer Leaves The Crease.  It is only fair to declare an interest here. Murphy is a good friend (and like the best of pals, we find plenty of scope for disagreement). But I didn&apos;t know him when I bought the book in 1983, so my regard for it cannot be ascribed to personal knowledge. Updated, with chapters on the eight &quot;new boys&quot; and a fresh introduction, it will find new readers every bit as receptive when Fairfield Books publishes it later this month.  &quot;Greatness&quot;: now there&apos;s something to set the hares running. Was Patsy Hendren not great? And how about Frank Woolley? &quot;A great cricketer,&quot; Murphy concedes, but not a great batsman. The Kent left-hander&apos;s Test record (average 36) was not strong enough. Perhaps he is right. It&apos;s a bit of a swizz to leave Tom Graveney off the list, so he&apos;ll have to settle for being a great pleasure-giver.  Was Boycott great? Murphy thinks he was a champion blocker, which prompts another question: is greatness a relative term or an absolute one? Both. It exists by itself, and also by degree. The fact that Debussy, say, wasn&apos;t as great a composer as Beethoven doesn&apos;t mean he wasn&apos;t great in his own way. Sir Jack Hobbs, a classicist, was great. So was Sir Vivian Richards, a romantic. Was anybody greater than King Viv in his maroon-capped pomp?  Setting the author&apos;s judgment to one side, Murphy does sport (and journalism) a notable service by refusing to scatter that most overused of adjectives over every head. There are never many great games players, just as there are never many great statesmen, or actors. It is a word best avoided, yet too many cling to it for rhetorical support, with an inevitable loss of perspective.  &quot;The media contributes to this hyperbolic tendency,&quot; says Murphy. &quot;Sky Sports labours under the impression that professional football began in 1992, the year they annexed the sport with their booty.&quot;  Cricket, fortunately, tends to attract more rigorous judges, though that may change. Some years ago Rodney Marsh was dropped by Channel 9 in Australia for not being sufficiently enthusiastic about the one-day cricket he was watching. Don&apos;t think, in the fizz-bang world favoured by modern administrators and television producers, that it couldn&apos;t happen here. There were rumours last autumn that a member of the Sky team was urged to &quot;bump up&quot; his commentary during the Stanford challenge match between West Indies and England.  Murphy&apos;s book is unique: the daisy-chain of 25 profiles covers the game&apos;s history, beginning with Dr Grace, the Great Victorian, who invented cricket as we know it, and bringing us bang up to date with Ramprakash, who remains active in his 40th year. Perhaps the ECB should distribute copies to the young men who represent England, some of whom are unfamiliar with players of the previous generation, never mind the golden period entre deux guerres.  Of those 25, who would you most like to have seen? John Woodcock, who could well be the most knowledgeable writer on any sport there has ever been, reckons the pair he would love to bring back, for two blessed hours, to be &quot;Denis&quot; and Richards. I&apos;ll take Compton, who, after the second world war, did as much as anybody to restore a nation&apos;s spirits. If that&apos;s not greatness, what is?  Frank Keating returns next week </body>
